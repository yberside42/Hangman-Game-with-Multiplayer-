- Learned to use global variables in a multi-file project.
- Learned how to implement logic with conditionals and loops.
- Learned how to use annotations to improve readability.
- Implemented default conditions for game options. 
- Improved handling of UI state changes in Tkinter (e.g., hiding second player options).  
- Improved my debugging skills and bug handling.
